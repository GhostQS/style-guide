How do we spell certain industry jargon and what do or don’t we capitalize?


* Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains[a] (L1, L2)
* Bitcoin—with capitalization—is used when describing the concept of Bitcoin or the entire network itself. e.g., "I was learning about the Bitcoin protocol today." bitcoin—without capitalization—is used to describe bitcoins as a unit of account.
   * In keeping with this, other crypto assets should also be lowercase:
      * ether (not Ether, but Ethereum – the blockchain — would be capitalized)
      * Etc…
* data availability layer (DAL)
* zero-knowledge rollups (ZK rollups) and Optimistic Rollups etc. but rollup (stand-alone)

[a]I have been noticing a lot of hyphenated versions of this in our texts (Layer-1, layer-1, etc). 


I've been trying to follow this convention. Are we doing it w/o hyphens?
[b]made these suggestions for casing.


supper uppercase but lowercase is probably fine too


*Just want to be consistent throughout articles/reports/etc
[c]as opposed to "lock-up"


I've seen both used throughout Onchain
